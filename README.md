# Custom-Balloons
A gorilla tag mod that allows you to load custom balloons!

# Usage
Start the game once with the DLL installed so it will create the folder for custom balloons then drag and drop any Unity asset bundle (with the correct stuff in it more on this below) then load the game and enable one or more of the custom balloons using the ingame pad!

# Unity Project
Here is the unity project for creating custom balloons https://github.com/Blas1ed/Custom-Balloons-Unity-Project!

How to:
Make a GameObject in the project make sure to add a "Knot" and a "Collider" in the GameObject the knot is where the string line goes into then once you make it a prefab you assign a asset bundle to it then right click and build asset bundles your file will be in the folder AssetBundles! the name of the gameobject is what the name of the custom balloon is ingame more on asset bundles here https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetBundlesIntro.html

you can also look at the Template model in the project
